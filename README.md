# The Continent Quiz
The continent quiz can be used to practice the continents. There are two different modes:
- Recognize continents
- Place continents
Possibly there will be a third mode in which you have to assign the names of the continents to the continents on the map.

## Recognize continents
In this game mode you have to recognize the continent and enter its name in the field. The continents are randomly rotated by 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees.
